Quiz bowl is an academic competition between schools in English-speaking countries; hundreds of teams compete in dozens of tournaments each year. Quiz bowl is different from Jeopardy, a recent application area. While Jeopardy also uses signaling devices, these are only usable after a question is completed (interrupting Jeopardy's questions would make for bad television). Thus, Jeopardy is rapacious classification followed by a race---among those who know the answer---to punch a button first.
Here’s an example of a quiz bowl question:
Expanding on a 1908 paper by Smoluchowski, he derived a formula for the intensity of scattered light in media fluctuating densities that reduces to Rayleigh's law for ideal gases in The Theory of the Opalescence of Homogenous Fluids and Liquid Mixtures near the Critical State. That research supported his theories of matter first developed when he calculated the diffusion constant in terms of fundamental parameters of the particles of a gas undergoing Brownian Motion.
In that same year, 1905, he also
published On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light. That explication of the photoelectric effect won him 1921 Nobel in Physics. For ten points, name this German physicist best known for his theory of Relativity.
ANSWER: Albert Einstein
Two teams listen to the same question. Teams interrupt the question at any point by “buzzing in”; if the answer is correct, the team gets points and the next question is read. Otherwise, the team loses points and the other team can answer.
